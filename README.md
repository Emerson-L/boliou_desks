# Boliou Desk Vandalism Tapestry

[Explore it here.](https://emerson-l.github.io/boliou_desks/)

At a school named Carleton in a building named Boliou Hall, there lies an old auditorium with 121 desks. Almost all of the desks sport a smattering of etchings made by distracted students, likely dating back to when the building was renovated in 1995. In my behavioral neuroscience class, my usual desk said "I've fallen and I can't get up," made a statement about the sexuality of one of our ultimate frisbee teams, and firmly demanded that I "TAKE LINGUISTICS!" I wanted to make a collage of all graffiti of students past and present, so I took pictures of all of the desks, manually gathered data on the locations of the desk within those pictures, did some image processing, and put the desks together in a psuedo-tesselation.

## Disclaimer
I take no responsibility for anything written or drawn on any of these desks. I have yet to find anything that I'd call overt hate speech on them, but also wouldn't say that everything on them is graceful. Similarly, I don't claim to have made any of the art. I'm only collaging what other students have put there themselves.

## Process
Take a picture, calibrate camera and undistort, warp perspective to the average aspect ratio, remove the background
